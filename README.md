# C-Greatest-Of-N-Numbers

This contains programs for greatest of 2 numbers to N numbers 

Note:- 
1) Time Complexity ~ T 
2) Space Complexity ~ S 

# Greatest_Of_2_Numbers.c
T ~ O(1) 
S ~ O(1) 

First file in the repository. Just finds greatest of 2 'double' data type numbers 

# Greatest_Of_3_Numbers.c
T ~ O(1) 
S ~ O(1) 

Just finds greatest of 3 'double' data type numbers 

# Greatest_Of_N_Numbers.c
T ~ O(n) 
S ~ O(n) 

This algorithm firstly saves all the numbers to an array. 
Then it iterates over the array and saves the current greatest to a temp variable. 
Then finally it prints the temp variable.
